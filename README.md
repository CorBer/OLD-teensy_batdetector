This is a work in progress project, the code and setup is still changing. If you have a specific request or otherwise questions please share them. 

Several specific libraries have been added to this repository, in de directory <b>lib</b> you can find them.

I am using a non-default programming setup for Teensy, that means that the code might not work in other environments.
