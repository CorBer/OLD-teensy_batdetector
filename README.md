# teensy_batdetector
Batdetector on Teensy3.6 (Based on original-code from Frank (DD4WH)
https://github.com/DD4WH/Teensy-Bat-Detector )

This is a work in progress project, the code and setup is still changing. If you have a specific request or otherwise questions please share them. 

I am using a non-default programming setup for Teensy, that means that the code might not work in other environments.

-PlatformIO Home 2.2.0Â·Core 3.6.7
